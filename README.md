# PSL Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks developed for courses offered at **PSL University** in the field of chemistry and artificial intelligence. The notebooks are 
designed to accompany lectures and workshops at Chimie ParisTech – PSL, and aim to provide hands-on experience with:

# Acknowledgement

For the construction of this repository, I am deeply indebted to Philippe Schwaller, whose outstanding course at EPFL — [AI4Chem](https://schwallergroup.github.io/ai4chem_course/) — served as a major source of inspiration and material. Several components of these notebooks were directly adapted and/or expanded from his work. I am grateful for his open sharing of resources and 
his pioneering contributions to machine learning in chemistry.
